# CanaryBot

CanaryBot works in the Wikimedia projects to help in the maintenance tasks. If you find some error, report it!

Now the code is being migrated for an old code, so it requires patience :)

## How-to use it by yourself

If you want to use CanaryBot or one of its scripts, you have to satisfy all the requirements:

1. Clone the repository.
2. `make all` (or `make help` if you want to know more about each task it would run if you run `make all`).
3. Run `./bot.py` to enjoy the bot! Altenatively you can run each task by yourself with `./TASKFILENAME.py`.
